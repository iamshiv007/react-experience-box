      In this internship, I worked on many projects, including an eCommerce
      application and a real-time chat system. Through this internship, I gained
      a strong command of Redux and Redux Toolkit. After completing this
      internship, I have gained the confidence and skills needed to develop a
      full-stack application for a real-world eCommerce site.
